# Starbucks® Carousel

This project is a web-based product carousel for showcasing Starbucks® beverages. The carousel is designed to highlight different products with unique descriptions and images, allowing users to navigate through the items using next and previous buttons.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: The CSS file used for styling the webpage and the carousel.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file used for handling the carousel's functionality.
- **images/**: A folder containing images of the Starbucks® products.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The carousel adjusts for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Product Details**: Each product in the carousel includes a name, price, description, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The carousel features smooth animations when navigating between products.
- **Auto-Play**: The carousel automatically progresses through the products every 5 seconds, with the option to manually navigate using the arrows.

## Customization

- **Images**: Replace the images in the `images/` folder with your own, ensuring that the file names match those referenced in `index.html`.
- **Product Information**: Update the product names, prices, and descriptions directly in the `index.html` file.
- **Styling**: Modify the `style.css` file to change the look and feel of the carousel.


## Usage

To use the carousel, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. Use the next and previous buttons to navigate through the products, or let the carousel auto-play through the items. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button will open the respective product page on the Starbucks® website.

## Credits
